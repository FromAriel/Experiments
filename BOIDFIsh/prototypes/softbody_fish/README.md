# SoftBody Fish Prototype

Experimental soft body fish based on a spring-mesh approach.
This folder contains a minimal Godot project for quick iteration.

## Feathered Stroke Demo

The scene now includes a dynamic distance-map generator that
creates a feathered outline or concentric ring effect around the
soft-body fish. Parameters such as `FB_stroke_width_IN` and
`FB_ring_spacing_IN` can be tweaked from the inspector.
